   """
   Extracts the value from the last <answer> tag in the text.

   Args:
       text (str): The model-generated text containing XML-style <answer> tags.

   Returns:
       str or None: The content inside the <answer> tags, or None if no valid answer is found.

   Explanation:
       1. Splits the text on the <answer> tag to isolate content after the tag.
       2. Checks if at least one <answer> tag exists in the text.
       3. For the last <answer> segment:
          - Verifies it contains a closing </answer> tag.
          - Extracts only the content between the tags.
       4. Returns None if the answer is empty (just "...") or if tags are missing.

   Extracts the answer from the GSM8K dataset examples.

   Args:
       text (str): The dataset example text containing a question and answer.

   Returns:
       str or None: The extracted answer part after the '####' delimiter, or None if not found.

   Explanation:
       1. Checks if the text contains the '####' delimiter that separates question from answer.
       2. If found, splits the text at this delimiter and returns the second part (the answer).
       3. The answer is stripped of leading/trailing whitespace.
       4. Returns None if no delimiter is present.

   Extracts the last number appearing in the text.

   Args:
       text (str): The text to extract a number from.

   Returns:
       float or None: The last number in the text, or None if no number is found.

   Explanation:
       1. Removes dollar signs and percent symbols from the text.
       2. Uses regex to find a number that appears at the end of the text (possibly after whitespace).
       3. The pattern matches numbers that appear at the end of the string, with or without decimal points.
       4. Returns the found number as a float, or None if no match is found.

   Returns:
       float or None: The single number in the text, or None if zero or multiple numbers are found.

   Explanation:
       1. Uses regex to find all numbers in the text (including negative numbers and decimals).
       2. If exactly one number is found, returns it as a float.
